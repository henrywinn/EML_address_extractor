# EML_address_extractor
Extracts email addresses from .eml files in a directory. Outputs a CSV file

Program finds emails in directory beside it called "emails".
This means if directory of program.py is ~/program.py, .eml 
files should be stored in ~/emails/

When run, it asks for an email address. This is used if you 
want to filter out addresses that are to you. The idea is that 
you only want to get addresses from emails that you sent 
because if you are using the output on a mailing list, you should 
only add email addresses of people you have corresponded with.

# Improvements
There are a ton to be made. This is a mockup. Look at issues 
on github for planned improvements
